# Deep-Learning-From-Scratch
# Description

This repository includes the implementation of following Deep learning models from scratch using Python 3 (Numpy):

•	Multilayer Perceptron including linear layers, batch normalization, loss functions, different activations (mlp.tar).

•	Both 1D and 2D CNNs including Maxpool and Dropout (cnn.tar,hw2_numpy.py).

•	Vanilla RNN, GRU, Greedy Search and Beam Search (RNNs.tar)

**Note: This project is part of my Homeworks. Current CMU students please refrain from going through the codes.**
